# Hangman-Game
Hangman Game inspired upon "Two Neurons" Youtube tutorial

C++ Project that reads in text file a list of words and randomly generates for user to guess. 

I made this project when I was learning C++ and preparing for one of my upper-level CS courses are my University.
To show I understood the concept, I created small tweaks to the project where I show the user playing the game the word they got wrong at the end should they fail to guess the word.
